# Objective Planning

* Type: Tactic

* Name: Objective Planning

* Id: TA02

* Summary: Objectives should be clearly defined, measurable, and achievable. Achieving objectives ties execution of tactical tasks to reaching the desired end state. There are four primary considerations:
- Each desired effect should link directly to one or more objectives
- The effect should be measurable
- The objective statement should not specify the way and means of accomplishment
- The effect should be distinguishable from the objective it supports as a condition for success, not as another objective or task.

* Phase: P01
